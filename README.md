# crappy-bird
*A year ago, a beginner Python programmer decided to make Flappy Bird but fill it with crap.
Using PyGame Zero - the beginner-friendly version of PyGame - and Piskel for crappy pixel art, he made it.*

To preserve authenticity, the original badly written code had never been changed or refactored, and is here in its full glory. I might create a repository with cleaner modern code later on. Soon™. But for now, you'll find:
1. camelCase mixed with snake_case and PascalCase
2. newlines, redundant parentheses, and inconsistent spacing everywhere in complete violation of PEP8
3. no logical spacing at all, everything is crushed together :D
4. `global` hell. Self-explanatory.
5. no documentation. Figure stuff out.
6. an excessive amount of weird hardcoded numbers

The game itself is quite hard, like the original Flappy Bird. No spoilers here. The only thing I'm revealing about the game is that your bird propulses itself with farts. The game also contains a backstory printed to the shell; read that if you want fart-filled lore to enhance the experience.

You will need to install PyGame Zero in order to play. [See the documentation here](https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

Have fun!
