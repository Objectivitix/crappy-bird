# Crappy Bird
*A year ago, a beginner Python programmer decided to make his first game: Flappy Bird but fill it with crap.
Using PyGame Zero - the beginner-friendly version of PyGame - and Piskel for crappy pixel art, he made it.*

To preserve authenticity, the original badly written code had never been changed or refactored, and is here in its full glory. I might create a repository with cleaner modern code later on. Soonâ„¢. But for now, you'll find:
1. camelCase mixed with snake_case and PascalCase
2. newlines, redundant parentheses, and inconsistent spacing everywhere in complete violation of PEP8
3. no logical spacing at all, everything is crushed together :D
4. `global` hell. Self-explanatory.
5. no documentation. Figure stuff out.
6. an excessive amount of weird hardcoded numbers

The game itself is quite hard, like the original Flappy Bird. No spoilers here. The only thing I'm revealing about the game is that your bird propulses itself with farts. The game also contains a backstory printed to the shell; read that (or just read it here) if you would like fart-filled lore to enhance the experience.

You will need to install PyGame Zero in order to play. [See the documentation here](https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

Have fun!

## Backstory - read if your shell doesn't work

Backstory:
The year was 2013. Flappy Bird had the most glorious time ever. People were loving him, praising him, he was the king of mobile arcade games. However, it didn't last long. Soon came the hate. Flappy Bird was insulted, discriminated, and abandonned. He lost his throne, and was exiled to the Craplands. There, he was tortured by the smell of the place and its inhabitants. Life was awful. Flappy Bird became Crappy Bird. Now, he couldn't take it anymore. He flies around Craplands looking for a road to freedom, a road that leads out of misery.

Credits:
Made in Python, game directly inspired by Flappy Bird. This is a fan-made version. Music - Nyan Cat(Original)
